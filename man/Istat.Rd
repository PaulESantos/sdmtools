\title{I Similarity Statistic for Quantifying Niche Overlap}
\usage{
Istat(x, y, old = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector or matrix of data; the matrix can be a raster of class
'asc' (adehabitat package), 'RasterLayer' (raster package) or
'SpatialGridDataFrame' (sp package)}

\item{y}{a vector or matrix of data with the same dimensions and class of
'x'}

\item{old}{a boolean identifying if "old" equation is to be used (see description).
This was kept for legacy issues.}
}
\value{
A single value that is the I similarity statistic
}
\description{
\code{Istat} computes the I similarity statistic of Warren et al. 2008. It
is a method for defining niche overlap from predictions of species'
distributions. \cr \cr \bold{NOTE:} it is assumed the input data are of the
same extent and cellsize, and all values are positive.
}
\details{
The I similarity statistic sums the pair-wise differences between two
predictions to create a single value representing the similarity of the two
distributions. The I similarity statistic ranges from a value of 0, where
two distributions have no overlap, to 1 where two distributions are
identical (Warren et al., 2008).

NOTE: updated to correct equation but not to worry about old... see explanation at

\examples{


#create some simple objects of class 'asc'
tasc = as.asc(matrix(1:50,nr=50,nc=50)); print(tasc)
#modify the asc objects so that they are slightly different
tasc1 = tasc + runif(n = 2500, min = -1, max = 1)
tasc2 = tasc + rnorm(n = 2500, mean = 1, sd = 1)

#ensure all data is positive
tasc1 = abs(tasc1)
tasc2 = abs(tasc2)

#calculate the I similarity statistic
I = Istat(tasc1,tasc2)
print(I) #high niche overlap

#using a more variable map
tasc2 = tasc + rnorm(n = 2500, mean = 25, sd = 15);tasc2 = abs(tasc2)
I = Istat(tasc1,tasc2)
print(I) #lower niche overlap
