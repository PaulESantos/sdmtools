\title{Landscape Patch Statistics}
\usage{
PatchStat(mat, cellsize = 1, latlon = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{a matrix of data with individual patches identified as with
\code{ConnCompLabel}; The matrix can be a raster of class 'asc' (this &
adehabitat package), 'RasterLayer' (raster package) or
'SpatialGridDataFrame' (sp package)}

\item{cellsize}{cell size (in meters) is a single value representing the
width/height of cell edges (assuming square cells)}

\item{latlon}{boolean value representing if the data is geographic. If
latlon == TRUE, matrix must be of class 'asc', 'RasterLayer' or
'SpatialGridDataFrame'}
}
\value{
a data.frame listing \item{patchID}{the unique ID for each patch.}
\item{n.cell}{the number of cells for each patch, specified in square
meters.} \item{n.core.cell}{the number of cells in the core area, without
the edge area.} \item{n.edges.perimeter}{the number of outer perimeter cell
edges of the patch.} \item{n.edges.internal}{the number of internal cell
edges of the patch.} \item{area}{the area of each patch comprising a
landscape mosaic.} \item{core.area}{represents the interior area of the
patch, greater than the specified depth-of-edge distance from the
perimeter.} \item{perimeter}{the perimeter of the patch, including any
internal holes in the patch, specified in meters.}
\item{perim.area.ratio}{the ratio of the patch perimeter (m) to area (m2).}
\item{shape.index}{the shape complexity, sum of each patches perimeter
divided by the square root of patch area.} \item{frac.dim.index}{fractal
dimension index reflects shape complexity across a range of spatial scales;
approaches 2 times the logarithm of patch perimeter (m) divided by the
logarithm of patch area (m2).} \item{core.area.index}{quantifies core area
as a percentage of patch area.}
}
\description{
\code{PatchStat} calculates the patch statistics for individual patches
identified in a matrix of data. The matrix can be a raster of class 'asc'
(adehabitat package), 'RasterLayer' (raster package) or
'SpatialGridDataFrame' (sp package).
}
\details{
The patch statistics are based on statistics calculated by fragstats

#define a simple binary matrix

#do the connected component labelling

image(t(ccl.mat[10:1,]),col=c('grey',rainbow(length(unique(ccl.mat))-1)))

#calculate the patch statistics
ps.data = PatchStat(ccl.mat)
