\title{Identify Regions of Significant Differences}
\usage{
SigDiff(x, y, pattern = TRUE)

ImageDiff(tasc, sig.levels = c(0.025, 0.975), tcol = terrain.colors(3), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector or matrix of data; the matrix can be of can be a raster of
class 'asc' (adehabitat package), 'RasterLayer' (raster package) or
'SpatialGridDataFrame' (sp package)}

\item{y}{a vector or matrix of data with the same dimensions and class of
'x'}

\item{pattern}{logical value defining if differences are respective to
relative patterning (TRUE) or absolute values (FALSE)}

\item{tasc}{a matrix of probability values (0 to 1) likely created by
\code{SigDiff}; The matrix can be a raster of class 'asc' (adehabitat
package), 'RasterLayer' (raster package) or 'SpatialGridDataFrame' (sp
package)}

\item{sig.levels}{the significance levels to define significantly above and
below. Default settings represent significance at the 0.05 level}

\item{tcol}{a set of 3 colors for use in the image to represent
significantly lower or greater, and not significant}

\item{...}{other graphical parameters defined by image() or plot()}
}
\value{
\code{SigDiff} returns a vector or matrix of the same dimensions and
class of the input representing the significance of the pairwise difference
relative to the mean and variance of all differences between the two inputs.
\cr \cr \code{ImageDiff} returns nothing but creates an image of the areas
of significant differences
}
\description{
\code{SigDiff} computes the significance of the pairwise differences
relative to the mean and variance of all differences between the two input
datasets. This is useful for identifying regions of significant difference
between two datasets (e.g., different DEMs (Januchowski et al. 2010) or
different species distribution model predictions (Bateman et al 2010)). \cr
\cr \code{ImageDiff} is a wrapper to the image.asc command in adehabitat
package that uses the result from \code{SigDiff} to create an image mapping
the regions of significant differences (positive and negative). \cr \cr
\bold{NOTE:} it is assumed the input data are of the same extent and
cellsize.

\examples{
#create some simple objects of class 'asc'
tasc = as.asc(matrix(1:50,nr=50,nc=50)); print(tasc)
#modify the asc objects so that they are slightly different
tasc1 = tasc + runif(n = 2500, min = -1, max = 1)
tasc2 = tasc + rnorm(n = 2500, mean = 1, sd = 1)

#create graphical representation
par(mfrow=c(2,2),mar=c(1,1,4,1))
image(tasc1,main='first grid',axes=FALSE)
image(tasc2,main='second grid',axes=FALSE)

#get significant difference by spatial patterning
out = SigDiff(tasc1,tasc2)
ImageDiff(out,main="Pattern Differences",axes=FALSE)

#get significant difference
out = SigDiff(tasc1,tasc2,pattern=FALSE)
ImageDiff(out,main="Absolute Differences",axes=FALSE)
