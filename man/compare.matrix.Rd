\title{Biplot Comparison of Matrices}
\usage{
compare.matrix(x, y, nbins, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a matrix of data; the matrix can be a raster of class 'asc'
(adehabitat package), 'RasterLayer' (raster package) or
'SpatialGridDataFrame' (sp package)}

\item{y}{a matrix of data of the same extent, cell size and class as 'x'}

\item{nbins}{number of equally spaced bins used to partition range of values
in 'x' & 'y'}

\item{...}{other graphical parameters defined by image(), contour(), or
plot()}
}
\value{
Nothing is returned but images are created.
}
\description{
\code{compare.matrix} compares the values within two matrices (e.g., ESRI
ArcInfo ASCII raster files) and produces a biplot that shows the frequency
of each data combination shared between the matrices. The plot is overlayed
with contour lines that demarcate parts of the the plot that share the same
frequency of data combinations. \cr \cr \bold{NOTE:} it is assumed the
matrices are of the same extent, cell size and scaled to be the same units.
}
\examples{


#create some simple objects of class 'asc'
tasc = as.asc(matrix(rep(x=1:10, times=1000),nr=100)); print(tasc)
#modify the asc objects so that they are slightly different
tasc1 = tasc + runif(n = 10000, min = -1, max = 1)
tasc2 = tasc + rnorm(n = 10000, mean = 1, sd = 1)

#create some images
#basic plot showing the density of data combinations shared
#by the two matrices
compare.matrix(tasc1,tasc2,20)

#same as previous but with data partioned amoung more bins
compare.matrix(tasc1,tasc2,50)

#same as previous but altering the number of contour levels
#and adding more graphical functions
compare.matrix(tasc1,tasc2,50,nlevels=5, xlab='asc1',ylab='asc2',
  main='Comparison between asc and asc2', bg="grey")
