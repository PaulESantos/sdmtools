}
\usage{
destination(lat, lon, bearing, distance)
}
\arguments{
\item{lat}{a single value or vector of values representing latitude in
decimal degrees from -90 to 90 degrees.}

\item{lon}{a single value or vector of values representing longitude in
decimal degrees from -180 to 180 degrees.}

\item{bearing}{a single value or vector of values representing the bearings
(directions) of interest ranging from 0 to 360 degrees.}

\item{distance}{a single value or vector of values representing the
distances in metres to the destination.}
}
\value{
Returns a data.frame with:
\item{lon1}{the original longitude}
\item{lat1}{the original latitude}
\item{bearing}{the bearing used}
\item{distance}{the distance used}
\item{lon2}{the destination longitude}
\item{lat2}{the destination latitude}
}
\description{
\code{destination} estimates the destination latitude and longitude given a
starting latitude and longitude, a bearing and distance. \cr \cr For general
information on Vincenty's formula, see e.g.,
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenty's_formulae}. It states: \cr
\emph{Vincenty's formulae are two related iterative methods used in geodesy
to calculate the distance between two points on the surface of an spheroid,
developed by Thaddeus Vincenty in 1975. They are based on the assumption
that the figure of the Earth is an oblate spheroid, and hence are more
accurate than methods such as great-circle distance which assume a spherical
Earth.} \cr \cr \bold{Note:} this method assumes a locations are lat & lon
given in WGS 84.
}
\details{
Typical useages are:\cr
\enumerate{ \item a single start location, bearing and distance to
give a single output location\cr --output would be a single destination location
\item a single start location with one or more bearings or distances
to give multiple output locations\cr --output would be a destination
locations for each combination of bearings and distances
\item multiple start locations with a single bearing or distance\cr
--output would be a destination locations representing the bearing
and distance from each of the start locations
\item multiple start locations with multiple bearings or distances
\cr --output would be a destination locations representing the
combinations of bearings and distances from each of the start
locations\cr
-- NOTE that the bearing and distance vectors must be of the same
length of the input lat and long.  }

See examples for all possible usages.
