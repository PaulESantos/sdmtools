\title{Grid Information from Geographic (lat lon) Projections}
\usage{
grid.info(lats, cellsize, r = 6378137)
}
\arguments{
\item{lats}{is a vector of latitudes representing the midpoint of grid cells}

\item{cellsize}{is a single value (assuming square cells) or a two value
vector (rectangular cells) representing the height (latitude) and width
(longitude) of the cells}

\item{r}{is a single value representing the radius of the globe in m.
Default is for the WGS84 elipsoid}
}
\value{
a data.frame listing:
\item{lat}{the latitude representing the
midpoint of the cell}
\item{top}{length of the top of the cell (m)}
\item{bottom}{length of the bottom of the cell (m)}
\item{side}{length of the side of the cell (m)}
\item{diagnal}{length of the diagnals of the cell (m)}
\item{area}{area of the cell (m2)}
}
\description{
Since spatial grids in geographic projections do not have equal area or
perimeters, \code{grid.info} extracts perimeter & area related information
for latitudinal bands with differing longitudinal widths. \cr\cr Outputs
lengths are in m using Vincenty's equation (\code{distance})and areas in m2.
Surface areas are calculated summing surface areas of spherical polygons as
estimated using l'Huiller's formula.

\examples{

#show output for latitudes from -87.5 to 87.5 at 5 degree intervals
