\usage{
read.asc(file, gz = FALSE)

read.asc.gz(file)

write.asc(x, file, gz = FALSE)

write.asc.gz(x, file)

write.asc2(x, file, sigdig = 0, gz = FALSE)

write.asc2.gz(x, file, sigdig = 0)

\method{image}{asc}(x, col = gray((240:1)/256), clfac = NULL, ...)

\method{print}{asc}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{a character string representing the filename of the input/output
file. The file extension should always be '.asc'.}

\item{gz}{defines if the object is or should be compressed using gzip}

\item{x}{an object of class 'asc' as defined in the adehabitat package}

\item{sigdig}{is the number of significant digits to write when creating the
ascii grid file}

\item{col}{for maps of type \code{"numeric"}, the colors to be used (see
\code{help(par)})}

\item{clfac}{for maps of type \code{"factor"}, a character vector giving the
names of colors for each level of the factor (see \code{help(colasc)})}

\item{\dots}{additional arguments to be passed to the generic function
\code{image} or \code{print}}
}
\value{
Returns a raster matrix of the class 'asc' defined in the adehabitat
package with the following attributes: \item{xll}{the x coordinate of the
center of the lower left pixel of the map} \item{yll}{the y coordinate of
the center of the lower left pixel of the map} \item{cellsize}{the size of a
pixel on the studied map} \item{type}{either 'numeric' or 'factor'}
\item{levels}{if type = 'factor', the levels of the factor.}
}
\description{
\code{read.asc} and \code{read.asc.gz} reads ESRI ArcInfo ASCII raster file
either uncompressed or compressed using gzip. \cr \cr \code{write.asc} and
\code{write.asc.gz} writes an asc object to a ESRI ArcInfo ASCII raster
file. The output can be either compressed or uncompressed. \cr \cr These
functions are faster methods based on the adehabitat import.asc and
export.asc.\cr\cr \code{write.asc2} and \code{write.asc2.gz} are even faster
implementations but have less error checking. \cr \cr \code{image.asc} and
\code{print.asc} are generic methods associated with plotting & summarizing
data of class 'asc'; they were modified from adehabitat package.
}
\details{
Implements a faster version of import.asc or export.asc from the adehabitat
package. In addition, files can be read in and written to in gzip compressed
format.\cr\cr Generic methods of print and image were modified from
adehabitat. Further details of them are found there.

\examples{


#create a simple object of class 'asc'
tasc = as.asc(matrix(rep(x=1:10, times=1000),nr=100)); print(tasc)

#write out the raster grid file
write.asc(tasc,'t.raster.asc')
write.asc.gz(tasc,'t.raster.asc') #actually save file name as t.raster.asc.gz

#read in the raster grid files
tasc2 = read.asc('t.raster.asc')
tasc3 = read.asc.gz('t.raster.asc.gz')

#remove the temporary raster
unlink(c('t.raster.asc','t.raster.asc.gz'))
